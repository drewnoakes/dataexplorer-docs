# Queries management

## .show queries

The `.show` `queries` command lists queries that have reached a final state, and that the user invoking the command has access to see. Optionally, the command can return queries that are still running, queries by specific users, or queries grouped by user. To see both queries and commands completion, use [.show queries-and-commands](commands-and-queries.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A [database admin or database monitor](./access-control/role-based-access-control.md) can see any command that was invoked on their database.
> - Other users can only see queries that were invoked by them.

**Syntax**

`.show` [`running`] `queries` [`by` *\** | `by user` *UserPrincipalName*]

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *UserPrincipalName* | string |  |  The UPN of a specific user for which to return a list of queries. |

**Returns**

- Returns a table containing previously run queries and their completion statistics. You can use KQL queries to explore the results.
- Returns a list of currently executing queries by the current user, or by another user, or by all users.

```kusto

| traceAgg(now(-5500d)) | 00:00:00.0312445 |

**Example 2**

This example returns the currently running queries by the current user.

```kusto
.show running queries 
```

This example returns the currently running queries by a specific user name.

```kusto
.show running queries by user <UserPrincipalName>
```

## .cancel query

The `.cancel` `query` command starts a best-effort attempt to cancel a specific running query. Cluster admins can cancel any running query. Database admins can cancel any running query that was invoked on a database to which they have admin access. All principals can cancel running queries that they started.

**Syntax**

`.cancel` `query` *ClientRequestId* [`with` `(` `reason` `=` *ReasonPhrase* `)`]

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *ClientRequestId* | string | &check; | Value of the running query's `ClientRequestId` property. |
| *ReasonPhrase* | string | &check; when reason specified | Describes the reason for canceling the running query and is included in the query results if it's successfully canceled. |

**Examples**

This example cancels a specific query using *ClientRequestId*.

```kusto
.cancel query "KE.RunQuery;8f70e9ab-958f-4955-99df-d2a288b32b2c"
```
